## Description

This program was created to try, with a friendly menu, to automate all important commands for all Ubuntu users.

All logfille's from command's will be saved separately. BEWARE that the logfilles of script are overwritten every time you run and appear ONLY if you select the correct selection.
So if you want to compare the logfiles before you run the same command, please backup the old one.

Also for better navigation maximize your terminal!! You can use the F11 hotkey.

## How to use it

Download the script from:

- https://github.com/GiwrgosAtmatsidis/ubuntu-script-for-general-use/archive/master.zip

Then unzip the folder. Open a terminal and `cd` into the unziped folder. Then you must make executable the script **unixgadged.bash** and run it from Terminal e.g.:

```
chmod +x unixgadged.bash
```
Then you can run it by invoking:

```
./unixgadged.bash
```

## Dependencies 

This script was created and tested on Ubuntu operating system. I can't any promise that it will operate safely on other operating systems such as Debian.
